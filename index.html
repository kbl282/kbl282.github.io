      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Kevin "Boogie" Borden is a student of the most professional kind. He goes to class, sits, listens, leaves class, rinses, and repeats. He has been doing this for years. Almost his entire life. You might wonder why he doesn't get a job. But that would declassify him as being a professional student. 
      <p>
        So get ready for some sitting.
