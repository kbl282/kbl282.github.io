      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Kevin "Boogie" Borden is a student of the most professional kind. He goes to class, sits, listens, leaves class, rinses, and repeats. He has been doing this for years. Almost his entire life. You might wonder why he doesn't get a job. But that would declassify him as being a professional student. 
      <p>
        So get ready for some sitting.

      <h4>Experience</h4>
      <section>
        <h5>Kellogg</h5>
        <p>Undergrad was not quite enough sitting, so I went crawling back for a graduate degree.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Cornell</h5>
        <p>School that thinks highly of the color red. Located on the other side of the country and sits upon a hill.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <h5>Foothill</h5>
        <p>This high school claims to be located at the foothills, but the nearest hills are more accurately piles of dirt.</p>

    </section>
    <h5>Hewes</h5>
        <p>Middle School was filled with anxiety ridden sitting. So much pressure on image and all the fun of elementary school was ripped away and flushed down the toilet. Not to mention that bastard that always stole my lunch.</p>

    </section>
    <h5>Arroyo</h5>
        <p>Arroyo elementary was the beginning of my professional sitting. Learned to compute equations. The whole reading thing didn't go as well.</p>
